Task 1 : Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP/1.1 : short for Hypertext Transfer Protocol 1.1, 
it is the foundation of communication on the World Wide Web.

Request-Response Model: HTTP/1.1 operates on a request-response model. 
Clients (usually web browsers) send requests to servers, which respond with data (web pages, images, etc.).
Each request contains a method (e.g., GET, POST), a URL, and headers.

Text-Based Protocol: HTTP/1.1 uses plain text messages. 
Requests and responses are human-readable.
However, this simplicity comes with overhead due to repeated header information.

Persistent Connections: Unlike its predecessor, HTTP/1.0, HTTP/1.1 supports persistent connections.
Multiple requests can be sent over a single connection, reducing latency.

Caching and Compression: HTTP/1.1 introduced caching mechanisms. Browsers store resources locally to avoid redundant downloads.
Gzip compression minimizes data transfer size.

Limitations: Head-of-Line Blocking: If one resource stalls, others behind it wait.

Latency: Multiple connections still incur latency.

----------------------------------------------------------------

HTTP/2 is the successor to HTTP/1.1, it revolutionized web communication.

Multiplexing: Unlike HTTP/1.1, which relied on separate TCP connections for each resource, HTTP/2 allows 
multiple requests over a single connection.
Data from various requests is interleaved, making it more efficient.

Binary Protocol: HTTP/2 uses a binary protocol, reducing overhead and improving performance.
Headers are compressed using HPACK, enhancing efficiency.

Persistent Connections: All requests share the same persistent connection, eliminating the need for repeated setup.
New requests create separate streams within the connection.

Server Push: HTTP/2 proactively pushes resources to the client cache.
No more waiting for subsequent requests; the server anticipates needs.

Backward Compatibility: HTTP/2 maintains compatibility with HTTP/1.1 methods and status codes.
It builds upon the past while embracing the future.
