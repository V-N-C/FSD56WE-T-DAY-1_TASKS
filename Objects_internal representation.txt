Task 2: Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

An object is a collection of key-value pairs that can store various types of data.

I have created the below example:

const obj = {
	  name: 'Navinchandru',
	  age: 24,
	  working: true	 
}

Internal representation:

We creted an object in which name, age and Working and known as KEYS and 'Navinchandru', 24, true are VALUES
we can manipulate the VALUES of a Key.
Object have a key which have a memory that helps to store the values. From there, We can access it.

In the above example, 'Navinchandru' is a value which is stored in the key 'name', 
this key value pair is present inside an object 'obj'.

Objects can store various data types, including strings, numbers, booleans, and even other objects.
